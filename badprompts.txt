do you know about Genuary, the generative art month organised by Piter Pasma? could you give me 31 new imagined prompts for Genuary, but make them like really shitty? for context, these are the suggested hints Piter gives people when contributing prompts:

```Tips for a great GENUARY prompt:
- Be complete. While single-word prompts are fine, remember we're going to vote and if your prompt isn't very clear without context, consider adding a bit of context :)
- Make a prompt that you would like to see _yourself_ spending a day on during GENUARY 2026 (even if you won't
have time, pretend you have that day of time). The point is that we don't really want prompts that would be cool to see the outputs of if _other_ people would do them for a day (if you get what I mean). This is also a reminder to myself :) :)
- Otherwise the sky's the limit, prompts come in many forms and shapes, and as far as I'm concerned, everything goes :)
- Well, okay, so there is one type of prompt I don't really like to see: "In the style of <ARTIST>". First of, if the artist is still alive, this is not really cool unless we ask them. And even if the artist is no longer alive, there can be problems with the estate (this actually happened on OpenProcessing from the Vera Molnar estate ...) (which sucks but it is what it is).

Inspiration from previous years:

But I want a list of humorous fake prompts that are actually really bad, stupid, wrong, mistaken, in an absurdistic way, that is not cringe, but actually quite clever every time, but also unique
