[Anna Lucia] 12 principles of animation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation)
[Anna Lucia] Map generator
[Anna Lucia] Nature's growth (explore an algorithm that simulates growth patterns found in nature)
[Baret LaVida] A color that explores, a single color travels across the canvas changing its shape but never its hue.
[Baret LaVida] A repeated shape, choose a simple figure and repeat it many times with minimal variations.
[Baret LaVida] Escape from the edge, a drawing begins on one edge of the canvas and pushes inward as if trying to escape.
[Baret LaVida] Lines that search for each other, two or more lines move or grow as if trying to meet somewhere on the canvas.
[Baret LaVida] Point storm, many randomly placed points reorganize themselves until a pattern begins to appear.
[Baret LaVida] Restless squares, a group of squares shifts in position or size without ever settling into order.
[Baret LaVida] The hidden figure, conceal a simple shape within a repetitive pattern so it is barely visible.
[Baret LaVida] Unexpected path, draw a route that changes direction based on one very simple rule.

[Chris Ried] User interaction with squares but the "wrong way"
[colormotor] Planar maps
[George Henry Rowe] Collisions (make some things, crash them in to each other. They might bounce, they might break up. Use a physics/collision lib if you like)
[George Henry Rowe] Happy (make something that makes people feel happy or joyful when they see it)
[George Henry Rowe] Lights on/off (make something that changes when you switch on the 'digital' lights)
[Ivan Dianov] A favicon sized game (16×16px). Did you know favicons can be animated in some browsers? Why waste this opportunity to play games?
[Ivan Dianov] A plant growing on a trellis. Make the rigid structure and something that can grow and climb it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellis_(architecture)
[Ivan Dianov] A rope-suspended city.
[Ivan Dianov] An alien space ship. Is it bionic or brutalist? Is it a battleship or they are just on a cruise?
[Ivan Dianov] An invisible object. Is it still possible to draw?
[Ivan Dianov] Dazzle camouflage. Wild cubist paintings on ships https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage
[Ivan Dianov] Graffiti. Wild tags, or a stencil art, or big colorful letters -- you choose!
[Ivan Dianov] Hieroglyphics

[Jonathan Barbeau] Create a composition using particle density as the main element (reference images available)
[Jonathan Barbeau] Make something with a flow field that doesn’t look like a flow field.
[Jonathan Barbeau] Remix a finished artwork using simple shaders
[Jonathan Barbeau] Use sound and rhythm
[Jos Vromans] 16x16  (a square or rectangular grid of just 16x16 blocks, and make an interesting pattern in there)
[Jos Vromans] a clock (something that displays time, or is inspired by analog clock, digital clock or watch, etc. Could be a live clock animation that takes the current time and displays hours/minutes/seconds in some visual way.  If this prompt makes it, I am happy to supply a small snippet to get anyone started using the current time)
[Jos Vromans] a single font character (choose one text character, and make it into an interesting artwork. Could be like calligraphy artwork with curves and ornaments, or very minimalistic and only use right angle edges,  or make a composition with many copies of the same font character. Also A decorated 'Initial' like in old books )
[Jos Vromans] custom font (for example: make an alphabet with custom drawn characters, and display them in a cool way as an artwork. This can be beautiful and complex curves, or limit the drawing to some basic rules, like how digital displays work (with a few bars, or limited amount of dots/pixels). To save time you can only focus on the numbers, or a few specific letters. Or even one single text character.  Another hint: there are cool things you can achieve with a few hand picked characters, for example those that have symmetry, like pq bd)
[Jos Vromans] For every square 1 circle and 2 triangles  (meant to be an arbitrary rule, where you would make something with squares, and for each square you draw you also have to draw a circle and 2 triangles. Those could be inside the squares as some sort of decoration, or outside the square being a big part of the composition, for example by making the squares very small, which could switch the focus to the circle or triangles)
[Jos Vromans] moving pixels (make something with pixels, and those pixels move, could be automata, pixel sorting, or any operation you can imagine to apply to pixels)
[Jos Vromans] One line  (an artwork that is made of a single line only)
[Jos Vromans] reflection (could be reflection over a line, resulting in symmetry, but doesn't have to be a line.)
[Jos Vromans] self portrait (for example: get started with a very basic human face: a few circles or oval shapes. And then depending on the time you have to invest, how far can you get to improve this by giving it features that actually look like you.  While adding eyes, eyelashes, hair, make a few parameters or colors variable. Even though you are aiming for a self portrait, it might be fun to render some random variations as well)
