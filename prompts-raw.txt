Cut-up : whether for text and/or images, implement some concepts of découpé (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique)

WikipediaWikipedia
Cut-up technique
The cut-up technique (or découpé in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to the Dadaists of the 1920s, but it was developed and popularized in the 1950s and early 1960s, especially by writer William S. Burroughs. It has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

Drip Till You Drop: create an artwork inspired by the "drip painting" technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_painting)

WikipediaWikipedia
Drip painting
Drip painting is a form of abstract art in which paint is dripped or poured on to the canvas. This style of action painting was experimented with in the first half of the twentieth century by such artists as Francis Picabia, André Masson and Max Ernst, who employed drip painting in his works The Bewildered Planet, and Young Man Intrigued by the Flight of a Non-Euclidean Fly (1942). Ernst used the novel means of painting Lissajous figures by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a horizontal canvas.Drip painting found particular expression in the work of the mid-twentieth-century artists Janet Sobel—who pioneered the technique—and Jackson Pollock. Pollock found drip painting to his liking… Show more
