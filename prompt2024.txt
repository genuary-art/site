this is a copypaste from an earlier thread in case it gets lost on Slack's 90 day history limit

I guess we could start a preliminary prompt suggestion thread right now if people have ideas :-)
Here are some guidelines (copied from last year) (no I'm not going to edit all the dates right now)
A few tips / suggestions
- When suggesting a prompt, imagine yourself taking part in GENUARY 2024 and spending a day on your prompt idea, instead of "it would be cool if people would do X for GENUARY 2024" (hope that makes sense)
- Maybe not prompts like "In the style of <living artist>", unless you're in contact with that artist and they are cool with it. E.g. in 2022 we had a prompt "The next next Fidenza" and I asked Tyler Hobbs if he was okay with it, which he was. But in 2023 we had "Yayoi Kusama" and I kinda wasn't sure what she would think if she heard about it or how to ask her permission. Hilma af Klint is not alive, and was a great prompt. Though I just remembered, in 2021 we had "Eno's Oblique Strategies", who is not only alive, but his deck of inspirational cards is probably copyrighted (but he also called generative artists getting into NFTs "little capitalist assholes", so I think we're even).
- Prefer concrete suggestions / complete prompts. E.g. instead of "use a specific colour palette (TBD)", "use colors #FF33FF #08CC22 #777777 #CCCCCC" (but please, not those colours). Mostly a request for myself to not have a lot of additional work filling in details when preparing the final list. Vague suggestions are fine for brainstorming purposes ofc.
- Maybe not re-use prompts from last year (2023). Older than that (2021, 2022) is fine imho, because then people who already did them, get to brag about it.
One of the coolest things about GENUARY is that everybody likes different kinds of generative prompts. If I had to come up with all the prompts, they would tend to be a little bit more math or code related. I think it's great the variety we've had over the years, and so don't feel like a prompt "should" be this or that (despite what I said above).

btw fractals as noise is pretty standard, fBm stands for "fractal Brownian motion" and it's the type of noise that p5 has. It was also what Mandelbrot studied, in a way, he studied stock markets and also fractal patterns in nature --- and there's basically two types of fractals in Nature: the ones that look like trees (sort of) and the ones that look like noise (rocks/mountains, ocean surface)
but I like fractals in non-obvious ways -- I'd just say "as noise" is one of the obvious ways :)

btw I think I'll also have to dig up all the prompts from last years, including the ones that didn't make it

Piter
  Sep 8th at 00:26
also, from having seen votes coming in over the past few years, having clear wording in the prompt is kind of vital for the final voting round
I'm gonna have to think about that


Piter
  Sep 8th at 00:29
at least what I saw was above the cutoff (for 31 prompts), they were generally all good
but below the cutoff it was either a case of the prompt just not being very good or perhaps it being worded awkwardly or unclearly
so with the voting I guess, I specifically want to find the "not very good" ones, separated from the unclearly worded ones to perhaps rewrite those somehow

Make something interesting with no randomness or noise or trig
I could write a whole essay about how philosophical this prompt is :)
Technically a PRNG is not random. And this matters because Rule 30 is a PRNG. That is a binary cellular automaton with a basic left-middle-right rule system. That's why it's called an elementary cellular automaton, and it can happen by accident in your algorithm if it gets complicated enough. So, when is something "interesting" and when is it "random", really?
To me this is the whole crux of my genart practice :) (well I try, at least, I also get distracted a lot)

mathworld.wolfram.commathworld.wolfram.com
Rule 30 -- from Wolfram MathWorld
Rule 30 is one of the elementary cellular automaton rules introduced by Stephen Wolfram in 1983 (Wolfram 1983, 2002). It specifies the next color in a cell, depending on its color and its immediate neighbors. Its rule outcomes are encoded in the binary representation 30=00011110_2. This rule is illustrated above together with the evolution of a single black cell it produces after 15 steps (Wolfram 2002, p. 55). 250 iterations of rule 30 are illustrated above. Starting with a single black...

Re: What u were saying 
@Piter
 I've been thinking about it a lot recently.   Prompted by someone I respect a lot saying "gen artists are too caught up on randomess".   I have SO many words for them, lol.   And yes, very much around.... "as soon as you try to do stuff without randomness pretty soon u will find u just made your own prng and I have a feeling that's a pretty circular thing doomed to repeat itself"

make your own fractal (can't be anything you've already seen)
make an iterative system - each image is a function of the previous - final art is the Nth image - videos encouraged
plotter art - pen must stay on the paper for the entire plot (those without a plotter can do a line drawing)
geometric art - pick either a circle, rectangle, or triangle and use only that geometric shape
