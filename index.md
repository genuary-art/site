<span id="arewethereyet">It's 2025 and GENUARY emerges!</span> GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It's happening during the month of January 2025, and everybody is invited!

Over the 744 hours of January, for every 24 hours there will be one prompt for your code art.

You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y'know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium. Feel free to use your own brain or a simulacrum of everybody else's.

# HASHTAGS

GENUARY happens on all the social media sites at once. If you like, you can use hashtags to keep track of things: share your work and tag it with **#genuary** and **#genuary2025** and also **#genuary1**, **#genuary2**, etc, depending on which prompt it is. 

This makes it easier to find other people doing the same prompt, which might not always be on the same day, because some people are from the future.

# [PROMPTS](prompts)

Click for the [prompts](prompts) for each day. Currently we are still in the process of curating the 31 finest prompts for you personally, so the ones you can see here are not yet real and not advised to be implemented. 

No worries, they'll be ready in time.

<!-- These are the actual 100% real prompts for GENUARY 2025, we won't change them after you've seen them.

Cheating is encouraged. Feel free to implement all these prompts before January. We will be seriously impressed if you do! Please share them! -->

# TIPS & TRICKS

* Prepare a nice framework for yourself before January to quickly be able to start trying out ideas.
* Don't get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and creative. If you start to resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively, take a break and think about what you want to get out of this. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom? Getting ideas? It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've got this.
* There's a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it's convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.

We also got a page with [frequently asked questions](faq)!
