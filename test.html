</pre>

<p><span id="arewethereyet">It’s 2024 and GENUARY resolves its Promise!</span> GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.</p>

<p>It’s happening during the month of January 2024, and everybody is invited!</p>

<p>Over the 744 hours of January, for every 24 hours there will be one prompt for your code art.</p>

<p>You don’t have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y’know, we put effort into this.</p>

<p>You can use any language, framework or medium, on any planet. Feel free to use your own brain or an inscrutable matrix of weights. You can even use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code>, it’s not like I can stop you.</p>

<h1 id="hashtags">HASHTAGS</h1>

<p>GENUARY is made of HASHTAGS!</p>

<p>Share your work and tag it with <strong>#genuary</strong> and <strong>#genuary2024</strong> and also <strong>#genuary1</strong>, <strong>#genuary2</strong>, etc, depending on which prompt it is.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to find other people doing the same prompt, which might not always be on the same day, because some people are from the future. GENUARY happens on all the social media sites at once.</p>

<p>To help out keeping track of all this we’re getting help from <a href="https://joyn.xyz">Joyn</a> again. They’re collecting all the hashtags if you tag your work with the tag for the right prompt (<strong>#genuary1</strong>, <strong>#genuary2</strong>, etc), you can check out the galleries for each day here: <a href="https://www.joyn.xyz/space/genuary--86970064ea53?tab=">GENUARY 2024 on Joyn</a> and also <a href="https://www.joyn.xyz/contest/genuary-prompt-gallery-genuary-3741d59112ee">here</a>! You can also view a <a href="https://www.joyn.xyz/space/genuary-f38cfe2e2fac?tab=open-calls">gallery of GENUARY 2023 on Joyn</a>, and you can curate your own collections of favourite pieces, even put them up for sale, so check it out!</p>

<h1 id="prompts"><a href="prompts">PROMPTS</a></h1>

<p>Click for the <a href="prompts">prompts</a> for each day. These are the actual 100% real prompts for GENUARY 2024, we won’t change them after you’ve seen them.</p>

<p>Cheating is encouraged. Feel free to implement all these prompts before January. We will be seriously impressed if you do! Please share them!</p>

<h1 id="tips--tricks">TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare a nice framework for yourself before January to quickly be able to start trying out ideas.</li>
  <li>Don’t get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and creative. If you start to resent dailies, or you find that it’s stunting you creatively, take a break and think about what you want to get out of this. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom? Getting ideas? It’s fine to skip days. If you’ve been on a streak and only have a few days left, you’ve got this.</li>
  <li>There’s a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it’s convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.</li>
  <li>Does your calendar for this month fumble the spelling of <em>Genuary</em>, perhaps like “January” or something? We’ve got you covered, check out these cool <a href="calendar">GENUARY Calendars</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>We also got a page with <a href="faq">frequently asked questions</a>!</p>
