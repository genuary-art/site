[Piero] Bauhaus Poster. Create a poster design with a Bauhaus feel.

# Prompts:
[Marnix Keller] photorealism
[Jos Vromans] reflection (could be reflection over a line, resulting in symmetry, but doesn't have to be a line.)
[Jos Vromans] moving pixels (make something with pixels, and those pixels move, could be automata, pixel sorting, or any operation you can imagine to apply to pixels)
[Jos Vromans] 16x16  ( a square or rectangular grid of just 16x16 blocks, and make an interesting pattern in there)
[Jos Vromans] One line  (an artwork that is made of a single line only)
[Jos Vromans] For every square 1 circle and 2 triangles  (meant to be an arbitrary rule, where you would make something with squares, and for each square you draw you also have to draw a circle and 2 triangles. Those could be inside the squares as some sort of decoration, or outside the square being a big part of the composition, for example by making the squares very small, which could switch the focus to the circle or triangles)
[Jos Vromans] custom font (for example: make an alphabet with custom drawn characters, and display them in a cool way as an artwork. This can be beautiful and complex curves, or limit the drawing to some basic rules, like how digital displays work (with a few bars, or limited amount of dots/pixels). To save time you can only focus on the numbers, or a few specific letters. Or even one single text character.  Another hint: there are cool things you can achieve with a few hand picked characters, for example those that have symmetry, like pq bd)
[Jos Vromans] a single font character (choose one text character, and make it into an interesting artwork. Could be like calligraphy artwork with curves and ornaments, or very minimalistic and only use right angle edges,  or make a composition with many copies of the same font character. Also A decorated 'Initial' like in old books )
[Jos Vromans] a clock (something that displays time, or is inspired by analog clock, digital clock or watch, etc. Could be a live clock animation that takes the current time and displays hours/minutes/seconds in some visual way.  If this prompt makes it, I am happy to supply a small snippet to get anyone started using the current time)
[Jos Vromans] self portrait (for example: get started with a very basic human face: a few circles or oval shapes. And then depending on the time you have to invest, how far can you get to improve this by giving it features that actually look like you.  While adding eyes, eyelashes, hair, make a few parameters or colors variable. Even though you are aiming for a self portrait, it might be fun to render some random variations as well)
[Anna Lucia] Nature's growth (explore an algorithm that simulates growth patterns found in nature)
[Anna Lucia] Map generator
[George Henry Rowe] Happy (make something that makes people feel happy or joyful when they see it)
[George Henry Rowe] Lights on/off (make something that changes when you switch on the 'digital' lights)
