Self portrait. For example, get started with a very basic human face, a few circles or oval shapes. How far can you improve this by adding features that actually look like you. Try adding eyes, eyelashes, hair, and make a few parameters or colors variable. Even though you are aiming for a self portrait, it might be fun to render some random 01. variations as well.

Pen plotter ready.

What if I don't have a plotter? A work is considered "plotter ready" if it can be drawn using a plotter. That's a drawing robot holding a pen. Kind of like a 3D printer, except for 2D. The limitation here is that a plotter can only draw lines. And also that it cannot erase lines. It can also not draw over the same spot 20 times because the robot doesn't care and the pen will rip through the paper. In theory you can draw a dot with a very short line or small circle, however it takes a small but non-trivial amount of time to lift up the pen and lower it again, so if you have 50 000 dots, this will take a lot of time. Another thing is that changing pens is a [hassle](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faff), so you don't want to do that too often, preferably not at all. It's also hard to make sure each new pen is neatly aligned with the earlier ones. Generally plotter artists use SVG files to represent their plots. However, you don't get to use the fancy SVG filters or anything. In fact you don't get to use the `fill` attribute! Because only lines, which includes having to use lines to hatch any filled areas. Now you might wonder why people even bother. The upside of plotters is that they are ridiculously precise and can draw with a super fine 0.25mm line on a 297x420 (A3) paper or larger, that you can get more interesting textures than printers (using e.g. ballpoint or fountain pens). And they work at night even when you're not looking. Another upside is that if you didn't know SVG, you only need to know a super tiny bit about SVG, because you only need/get to draw lines.
