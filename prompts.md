Wobbly function day.

[Wobbly Functions](https://piterpasma.nl/articles/wobbly) are a name I've given to smoothly undulating formulas made from modulated sine waves. Usually it's formulas of the form:
{:.info}

`sin(a * b + c + d * sin(e * f + g)) + sin(h * i + j + k * sin(l * m + n)) + ...`
{:.info}

Or something along those lines. Don't worry about angles or trigonometric identities, just go with the wobble!

Less than 1KB artwork.

You can decide if you want to go for size coding, for 1KB of output, or whatever you think would be appropriate, today. If you go for size coding, we made some [tiny boiler plate code samples](tinycode) for you to start with.

If you like generative art, you probably have some photos on your phone of cool looking patterns, textures, shapes or things that you've seen. You might have even thought, "I should try to recreate this with code". Today is the day.

Skeuomorphism.

A skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains attributes from structures that were necessary in the original. Skeuomorphs are typically used to ~~gate keep generative art styles~~ make something new feel familiar in an effort to speed understanding and acclimation. They employ elements that, while essential to the original object, serve no pragmatic purpose in the new system. (from [Wikipedia on Skeuomorphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph))

Shaders.

Use the GPU. I did a [Shader Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGvuSOvuREQ) a while back where I explain how to code a shader in WebGL2 from scratch (and also finally a simple raymarcher, but you can do many other things with shaders too).

Generative music / Generative audio / Generative sound.

While many of you probably know that Ambient music often employs generative strategies, Psy-Trance is another genre that uses generative techniques. Check out e.g. [Dash Glitch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dash+glitch+generative)
