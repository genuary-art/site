Hey everyone!! In about 2 months it'll be time for GENUARY 2026 !!!

You maybe know how it works by now, 31 days, 31 prompts, and we're going to need prompts! :-)

The first step is collecting as many cool prompts as possible. Then at some point I will call it quits and put all the prompts into this very cool voting website that @Quag made. And then we're going to use the top 31 prompts for GENUARY!!

Tips for a great GENUARY prompt:

- Be complete. While single-word prompts are fine, remember we're going to vote and if your prompt isn't very clear without context, consider adding a bit of context!

- Make a prompt that you would like to see _yourself_ spending a day on during GENUARY 2026 (even if you won't 
have time, pretend you have that day of time). The point is that we don't really want prompts that would be cool to see the outputs of if _other_ people would do them for a day (if you get what I mean).

- Otherwise the sky's the limit, prompts come in many forms and shapes, and as far as I'm concerned, everything goes :)
